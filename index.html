        <br>
        <p id="hisp">Dear Parents, Family and Friends,

            Welcome to our Community! We are a vibrant, small and strong community-based school. Our community is rich with diverse families that provide differing perspectives, backgrounds and cultures that enrich our learning environment. We value parent and community involvement and as such I encourage you to be involved in our School Council.

            We are a ‘Community of Learners’; students, staff and our community work together to learn together. We focus on academic excellence and provide our students with the skills that they will use later on in life. We achieve this by collaborating and working together to create an inclusive, safe, friendly and stimulating environment. All students, staff, parents/guardians and community members are valued and respected for their diversity and uniqueness. We teach tolerance, promote individuality and provide exemplary programming for our students by instilling critical thinking, self-discipline and a love of learning. We believe that all children can learn successfully and attain high levels of academic and social success.

            A commitment to lifelong learning will continue to be the goal of our community. Providing rich opportunities through the curriculum and cross-curricular opportunities creates a prolific learning context for children to experiment, explore and ultimately demonstrate their learning in a positive and powerful way.

            You can teach a student a lesson for a day; but if you can teach them to learn by creating curiosity, they will continue the learning process as long as they live. ~Clay P. Bedford

            Enjoy the journey!
